# Challenge name

**Flag:** `picoCTF{adlibs}`

How you approached the challenge:

- step 1
i reversed th encryption program to get the decrypted code
```
for char in ciphertext:
    cur = lookup2.index(char)
    original_index = (cur + prev) % 40  # Reverse the modular subtraction
    decoded_text += lookup1[original_index]
    prev = original_index

```

- step 2
now we get another program in which if we put the program in python 2 itself we will get the flag
```
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1
```





What you learned through solving this challenge:

1. basic idea of cryptography
