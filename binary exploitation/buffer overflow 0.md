**Flag:** `picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}`

How you approached the challenge:

- step 1
well the name of challenge is buffer overflow , so i started looking for overflows and found 1 where buf2 is defined with 16 space and there is strcpy fn which copies our input to it

- step 2
so simply gave input of something bigger than 16 which caused the overflow and got the flag 

What you learned through solving this challenge:

1. what is buffer overflow 
2. how to exploit it
