# Challenge name

**Flag:** `picoCTF{L34k1ng_Fl4g_0ff_St4ck_95f60617}`

How you approached the challenge:

- step 1

well on close observation we can see that the printf fn is directly printing the value of story without any format specifiers
- step 2

this can be exploited as if we give  %p it will start printing adresses of the stack

- step 3
now by creating a loop in shell we will access the value of every address as one of them contains the flag 
```
for i in {1..999}; do echo "%$i\$x" | nc saturn.picoctf.net 51470;done
```


What you learned through solving this challenge:

1. format string exploit
2. loops in shell
