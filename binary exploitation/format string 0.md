How you approached the challenge:

- step 1
well on anaylsis of the c file
we know that the first choice must have no. of char greater than 32
but none of the choice on the menu has it 
on closer look the choice Gr%114d_Cheese has '%114d' which is a format specifier and 114 char long 
thus this option is the correct one 

- step 2
during second choice spongebob wants something outrageous 
now here there is no condition on what we should choose 
so by trying all three the correct choice was Cla%sic_Che%s%steak
then after a lot of thinking the difference was that this choice had three %s with no strings provided
maybe this could cause some errror and thus was coorect as spongebob wanted outrageous
