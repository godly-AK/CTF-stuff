**Flag:** `picoCTF{549698}`

How you approached the challenge:

- step 1
first i learnt basic cmds of gdb and how it helps in debugging c/c++ files

- step 2
next we use 'gdb debugger_a'
then set break point at main and after running the elf file it will stop just before main function 

- step 3
now by using 'next' we will run the main fn and use 'info registers eax'
then convert it to decimal to get the flag


What you learned through solving this challenge:

1. How to use GDB to analyse a file
2. what is eax
