# GDB baby step 2

**Flag:** `picoCTF{307019}`

How you approached the challenge:

- step 1
since the question looked the same as in 1 itried the same thing and it worked
used `gdb debugger_b`
- step 2
then used `break main` and then `run`
- step 3
  did `next` to go into main and then id `info registers eax` and done
